## Conflict Plan

Before conflict arrises

- Am I orientated towards the problem?
- Am I feeling safe?
- Am I feeling valued?
- Agree to put our best effort in and not push blame on anyone for faults in project

If someone is dealing with a technical issue

- 15 minute rule and then ask the group and then take the group to TA help from there
- Message group chat in slack

To mitigate one person from taking over the project, we will inject pair programming time wherever needed during our lab time

If the team feels that one person isn't contributing, we will have a polite conversation to figure out if they have any mental blockers in place

If an individual feels unsafe in the group or feels the need for help resolving conflicts, that individual should ask the instructor to mitigate.

## Communication Plan

- Primary Communication hours: 8:30am - 6pm

- Secondary Communication hours: 6-10pm

During primary communication hours we will be readily available to communicate back and forth
During secondary communication hours we the group chat on slack is available but don't rely on that time

- Take breaks once an hour or after completing a big problem. If group is fatigued

- During debriefing, set time for each member to give feedback on the group's progress, process, or anything on their mind

## Work Plan

- The wireframe and user stories are going to be our main tools in identifying tasks

- During our morning standup we will decide as a group what tasks need to be done and who will do it

- Github Projects will be our main tool for project management aside fromt the standups and sitdowns

## Presentation Deck

- Make sure we have a powerpoint presentation with everyone contributing speaking parts

## Git Process

- Github
  - One person will create an orginization on github and add all group members
  - That person will make a repo and send the link to group
  - Each person will work on their own branch
  - There will be a staging branch before we merge to the main branch
  - Only merge into the main branch from the staging branch
  - Agree not to merge into the main branch from staging branch unless group collectively agrees
  - Have at least 2 people work on merge conflicts
